      Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pritika Giri, a passionate beginner web developer currently exploring Node.js, Express, and EJS.
      I created this blog as a part of my journey toward becoming a full-stack developer.

      <br><br>

      Through this blog, I share my learning experiences, small projects, and tutorials in web development.
      My posts cover topics like JavaScript, backend basics, and frontend experimentsâ€”written in a way I wish I'd found when I was starting.

      <br><br>

      This space helps me stay motivated and, hopefully, helps others who are just starting out. 
      In the future, I aim to include in-depth guides, real-world projects, and maybe even video tutorials!

      <br><br>
